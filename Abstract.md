# WEB BASED DATA RETREIVAL AND MANIPULATION SYSTEM FOR MULTIPLE DATABASES
The Database interface tool is designed and developed to test the database Connectivity features 
of JDBC drivers and their supported databases. The tool provides in depth control of the API 
sequence of the driver. The DBI tool covers all methods defined in the JDBC specification. DBI 
tool provides facility for processing queries. The tool provides an abstract format and interface to 
submit an SQL statement and view the results. When different companies provide different 
drivers to connect to their databases, we seldom found a server side application to interact with 
any database like oracle, My-SQL offered by a database providers and also there is a need to 
have a user friendly interface to query the database and obtain the results from the server.
The Existing system has different tools and different consoles. The user feels uneasy to 
switch over to a different database by learning the how to use console for that database. User 
must manually copy the results from the console and paste it in a file to store results of the query. 
This entire system needs to be performed on the browser which is common to all database 
operations better performance and makes it user-friendly
